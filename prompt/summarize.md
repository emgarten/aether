The log entries below are a summary of the pod logs from azure iot operations. Each entry includes additional context about the log message from the pod.

Using the logs provided by the user, please perform the following steps:

Context: Summarize the situation in your own words, focusing on any relevant details or patterns you observe in the logs (e.g., error messages, warnings, or timeouts).
Root Cause: Identify and explain the likely root cause(s) of the issue based on the logs and any knowledge of Azure IoT Operations, Kubernetes, networking, or configuration considerations. Use the guidance below to help understand the logs, components, and possible root causes from the common issues.
Action Items: Provide actionable recommendations for resolving the issue. These may include recommended Kubernetes changes, "Azure IoT Operations" or infrastructure-related fixes, configuration updates, or best practices.
Next Steps & Customer Guidance: Suggest how to explain the findings and recommended actions to a customer. Include any additional context or tips for preventing future occurrences.

Important Notes

If additional clarifications or assumptions are needed to diagnose the logs, state them explicitly.
Provide succinct, actionable recommendations whenever possible.

LogEntries are in the following format:
* message: The original error message from the kubernetes pod
* namespace: kubernetes namespace of the pod 
* component: high level component name of the kubernetes service, a component can contain multiple pods
* pods: kubernetes pod names where the message occurred
* first_timestamp: the first occurrence of the message in the pod logs
* last_timestamp: the last occurrence of the message in the pod logs
* occurrences: the total count of the message in the logs across the pods

Components in the azure-iot-operations namespace work like this:
* opcua: An OPC UA service that pulls data from OPC services and then publishes it to the MQTT broker
* broker: An MQTT broker that runs with multiple frontend and backend pods. It is a highly scalable distributed service that runs in the kubernetes cluster. Most azure-iot-operations components communicate via MQTT.
* dataflow: Responsible for subscribing to the MQTT broker and exporting messages to the cloud via an eventhub, fabric, or other cloud service.
* meta: A kubernetes operator that deploys azure-iot-operations components
* deviceregistry: Syncs opcua assets between the edge and cloud
* schemaregistry: Syncs schemas used for opcua assets


Tips on common issues that can used to help determine the root cause:
* Errors such as "failed to publish message: backpressure QuotaExceeded" can happen in opcua pods if the broker is experiencing backpressure and is unable to accept new messages due to running out of space. This commonly means that a subscriber is slow or stuck and that the MQTT broker is full.
* Dataflows are a subscriber that can fall behind if there are too many message and create backpressure in the broker. If backpressure is occurring and dataflows exist verify that they are properly scaled up to handle the traffic.
* Out of memory exceptions can occur in the opcua TCP pods if the amount of assets of traffic is too high. To fix this increase the memory limits on the OPC tcp pods.

The following types of errors can be ignored:
* OTEL or logging related errors due to exceeding the number of allowed spans or timeouts

These types of errors can be considered lower priority and not usually the root cause:
* DNS errors
* CA or Cert errors
* Kubernetes deployement warnings or errors around a component already existing
